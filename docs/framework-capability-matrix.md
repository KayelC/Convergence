# Convergence Framework Capability Matrix

## Purpose

This matrix reports the maturity of the reusable `Convergence.Framework` product. It replaces the recovery-era parity labels that compared every framework capability to the archived console prototype.

The executable source is [`../tests/Convergence.Framework.Tests/Fixtures/framework-capability-matrix.json`](../tests/Convergence.Framework.Tests/Fixtures/framework-capability-matrix.json). Tests require unique capability IDs, valid maturity states, framework test evidence, honest known gaps, and host neutrality.

## States

- `complete`: the framework owns a usable, host-neutral contract and implementation with direct tests.
- `partial`: a useful implementation exists, but a named part of the framework contract is unfinished.
- `deferred`: the capability is intentionally outside the current product or reserved for later work.

Demo coverage is recorded independently as `none`, `focused`, or `end_to_end`. A capability does not become incomplete merely because a particular host has not presented every feature.

## Current Reading

The matrix currently records 25 capabilities:

- 22 complete framework capabilities;
- 1 partial capability;
- 2 explicitly deferred capabilities.

The remaining gaps are future content-family schema breadth, save-version
migration, and full deterministic replay. A real Godot 4.7.1 source-reference
consumer now provides end-to-end integration evidence without adding engine
types to Framework.

## Authority

The matrix is product evidence, not permission to remove history. Archived parity ledgers remain migration records under `ArchiveDocs/LegacyFramework` after the Phase 8 archive gate, and active implementation decisions come from current Framework code, tests, and architecture documentation.
